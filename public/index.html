    # Miller’s Law - The average person can only keep 7 (plus or minus 2) items in their working memory.
    I've used chunking as an effective method of presenting groups of content in a manageable way. As an example, you will see there are primary and secondary menus. Throughout the site, you will see that there are no more than 5 items in any particular group.

            I've added a border around these group of elements to create common region. This helps the user identify them as an important unit to warrant their attention.

            This can grouping also be argued as the law of proximity.
